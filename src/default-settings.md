##### I've long suspected that while advances in science and thought can happen at a breakneck pace, our collective worldview can not update at a similar pace. New discoveries can undo our understanding of reality in an instant, but it can take centuries for those ideas to truly reshape how regular people see the world.

##### In that sense, I think our worldview is still living in the 1800s. We've updated our technologies, but not our core beliefs. Our science may be modern, but our assumptions are still Victorian.

##### So, let's start exploring this idea by making an attempt to map out the default worldview of the average modern mind, the unspoken assumptions that most of us, consciously or not, take for granted.

### Reality

- The world is made of matter. It is mechanical, measurable, and governed by cause and effect.
- Everything that happens has a material explanation.
- Science is the ultimate arbiter of truth. If you can't measure it, it's not real.

### Human Nature

- People are born blank. They are shaped mostly by environment, education, and social context.
- Human beings are rational and generally act in their self-interest.

### Morality

- Ethics are human constructions, not of divine origin.
- Equality is good. Hierarchy is bad.
- Freedom is the highest value, especially freedom to self-express.
- A good life is one of self-fulfillment: to be authentic, happy, and self-actualized.
- Religion is outdated; purpose is something you create, not something you are given.

For most of us alive today, this feels simply like the way things are. But these ideas aren't self-evident truths.

So where did they come from?<br>Why do we believe all this?<br>Should we still continue to have these beliefs?

Let's break it down.

### Part I: The Architects of the Modern Mind

#### Reality: Where These Beliefs Came From

The modern concept of reality as mechanical and measurable emerged during the Scientific Revolution (17th–18th century), and solidified through the Enlightenment and Industrial Age.

The key architects were:

- **René Descartes (1600s)** — Split reality into mind and matter. Matter was “stuff”: predictable, measurable, soulless. Mind was the private domain of thought. This Cartesian dualism separated consciousness from the physical world, and set up the idea that nature was a machine.
- **Isaac Newton (1687)** — Built the mathematical model of that machine. In Newton's universe, every action has a precise cause and effect, every future can be predicted if we know the initial conditions. This birthed mechanistic determinism, the notion that the universe runs like clockwork.
- **Francis Bacon (1620)** — Championed empirical science: the idea that knowledge should be grounded in observation and experiment. This gave us the scientific method, extraordinarily powerful, but it also reinforced the belief that only what can be measured is real.

#### Human Nature: Where These Beliefs Came From

The modern view of human nature, as rational, self-interested, and shaped primarily by environment, emerged between the Enlightenment and early Industrial Age.

The key architects were:

- **John Locke (1689)** — Introduced the idea of the tabula rasa, the “blank slate.” Humans, he argued, are born without innate ideas; everything we become is written by experience and education. This gave rise to modern liberalism, and later, social engineering and behaviorism.
- **Adam Smith (1776)** — In The Wealth of Nations, he described human beings as rational agents pursuing self-interest. Though Smith himself believed in moral sympathy, his ideas were distilled into homo economicus, the self-maximizing individual, a cornerstone of modern economics.
- **Charles Darwin (1859)** — Evolution by natural selection reframed human behavior as a struggle for survival and reproduction. Over time, this was simplified into the idea that competition and self-interest drive all progress — biologically, economically, socially.

#### Morality: Where These Beliefs Came From

The modern view of morality, that ethics are human constructions, that equality and freedom are the highest goods, and that the purpose of life is self-fulfillment was once again born during the Enlightenment and matured through the social revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.

The key architects were:

- **Immanuel Kant (1785)** — Placed morality within human reason. Each person, as a rational agent, could determine right and wrong through universal logic, independent of divine command. This made ethics subjective yet universal, a matter of conscience, not scripture.
- **Karl Marx (1848)** — Brought moral language into the material world. He reframed morality as justice between classes, equality as the supreme virtue, hierarchy as exploitation. His moral framework of “oppressor vs. oppressed” still underpins our cultural ethics.
- **John Stuart Mill (1861)** — Advanced utilitarianism: the idea that morality's purpose is to maximize happiness and minimize suffering. The good life became a matter of pleasure, empathy, and self-determination.
- **Friedrich Nietzsche (1882)** — Declared the death of God and with it, the collapse of objective morality. Humans must create their own values.

### Part II: The Anomalies of Our Modern Times

Here is the problem: **Science has already proven most of the above to be false.**

#### Reality: The Dissolution of Matter

If the Victorian worldview was built on the idea that the universe is a giant room filled with solid objects bounicng off each other, the physics of the last two centuries have slowly dissolved both the objects and the room.

- **Michael Faraday & James Maxwell (1860s)** - Discovery of fields: proof that the universe is permeated by invisible fields (electromagnetism). Energy can move through empty space; forces exist without matter touching.

  - This shattered **Materialism**. It proved that "empty space" isn't empty, and the fundamental stuff of reality isn't just hard "matter," but invisible webs of force.

- **Albert Einstein (1905)** - Relativity: Einstein proved that space and time are not fixed containers, but a single fabric that stretches and bends depending on the observer's speed and gravity.

  - This shattered **Objectivity**. It destroyed Newton's "Universal Clock." There is no "God's eye view" of the universe where "now" is the same for everyone. Reality is not a static stage; it is relative to the observer.

- **Niels Bohr & The Quantum Pioneers (1920s)** - The uncertainty principle: quantum mechanics revealed that at the fundamental level, matter does not exist at solid particles with definite locations. Instead, subatomic particles exist as "wave functions." They only collapse into a definite position when they are observed.

  - This shattered **determinism,** as in a clockwork machine, if you know the position of every gear, you can predict the future perfectly. In a quantum world, the future is probabilistic, not determined.

- **Kim et al. (1999)** - The delayed choice quantum eraser: an experiment where the choice to measure a particle is made *after* the particle has already passed through the slit. The results show that a decision made in the present can seemingly determine how a particle behaved in the past.

  - This shattered **Linear Time**. It suggests that the arrow of time is not as rigid as we think, and that the past and future may be entangled in ways that defy simple cause-and-effect.

- **Dean Radin (2000s)** - The psychophysical interaction: while still controversial, experiments involving the "double-slit" test have suggested that focused human attention alone can cause the quantum wave function to collapse.

  - This threatens the **Separation of Mind and Matter**. If proven true, it implies that consciousness is not just a passive observer inside the skull, but an active participant that physically shapes the reality around us.

- **Alain Aspect, John Clauser, & Anton Zeilinger (2022)** - The death of local realism: these physicists confirmed experimentally what decades of theory had suggested; the universe is not "locally real." "Not Real" means objects don't exist until they are observed, like a modern video game that only renders the areas of the map that the player is looking at. "Not Local" means particles can influence each other instantly across vast distances, implying the existence of some form of connection layer beneath our physical reality.

  - This was the **Final Nail in the Coffin**. It implies that space is an illusion, just a surface-level rendering, and that underneath, everything is connected in a single, unified network. The universe is not a machine; it is a relationship.

#### Human Nature: The Biological Avatar

If our view of reality has lagged behind physics, our view of ourselves has lagged just as far behind biology and neuroscience. We still operate on the assumption that humans are miniature Newtonian machines: rational, self-contained, and programmable by their surroundings. We believe that with enough education and the right environment, any human can be molded into anything.

However, the science of the last century has revealed that we are not software that can be rewritten, but hardware with pre-installed firmware.

- **Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky (1970s - 2000s)** - Behavioral economics: through decades of research Kahneman & Tversky revealed that the human mind operates on two systems: one fast and emotional, one slow and logical. Most of our decisions are driven by the former.

  - This shattered **Homo Economicus** (The Rational Man). It proved that we do not calculate utility; we rationalize instincts. We are not logic machines; we are storytelling machines who invent reasons for our feelings after the fact.

- **Thomas Bouchard Jr. (1979 - Present)** - The Minnesota twin studies: by studying identical twins separated at birth and raised in entirely different environments, behavioral geneticists discovered that genes influence nearly everything. Intelligence, temperament, risk-taking, politics, and even religious beliefs are highly heritable.

  - This shattered the **Blank Slate** (Tabula Rasa). It proved that humans are not born empty, waiting to be written upon by society. We are born with a template. Environment matters, but it interacts with a fixed biological nature rather than creating it from scratch.

- **Leda Cosmides & John Tooby (1990s)** - Evolutionary Psychology: by applying Darwinian logic to the human mind, this field revealed that our psychology is not designed for the modern world, but adapted to the Pleistocene savannah. It also highlighted that because men and women faced different reproductive pressures for millions of years, they evolved distinct psychological strategies.

  - This shattered **Social Constructionism.** It suggests that many human behaviors are not merely "social constructs" invented by patriarchal culture, but biological adaptations.

#### Morality: The Survival Algorithm

While we clung to the Enlightenment idea that morality is a matter of "fairness," "equality," or "maximizing happiness," the sciences of the 20th century quietly revealed something much colder: Morality is a survival technology.

We realized that "Good" and "Evil" are not abstract cosmic truths, nor are they rational decisions made by individuals. They are algorithmic solutions to the problem of cooperation.

- **John von Neumann & John Nash (1940s-50s)** - Game theory: by mathematically modeling conflict and cooperation, these mathematicians proved that moral behaviors like trust, reciprocity, and punishment are not "nice ideas," they are mathematical necessities.

  - This shattered **Kantian Idealism.** It revealed that ethics are not derived from "pure reason" or a "categorical imperative." They are derived from the cold mathematics of survival. We don't cooperate because it is "right"; we cooperate because groups that don't cooperate go extinct.

- **W.D. Hamilton & E.O. Wilson (1960s–70s)** — Sociobiology & Kin Selection: they solved the problem of altruism. Why would an animal sacrifice itself for another? Not out of empathy, but because of Inclusive Fitness. If you die to save three siblings, your genes still survive.

  - This shattered **Individualism.** It proved that the fundamental unit of survival is not the individual, but the gene and the group. Self-sacrifice is a biological imperative, not just a noble choice.

- **Nassim Taleb (2000s)** - The Lindy effect: building on complexity theory, this concept suggests that for non-perishable things (like ideas or morals), the only judge of validity is **Time**. Systems that align with reality survive; systems that violate reality collapse.

  - This shattered **Utilitarianism.** It implies that the goal of a moral system is not to maximize *happiness,* but to maximize *survival.* 

### The Great Latency

If the scientific consensus on reality, human nature, and morality shattered ages ago, why are we still running the old software?

The answer lies in cultural latency. A worldview is not just a list of facts; it is a psychological immune system. It protects us from chaos. To swap out "Materialism" for "Quantum Probability" or "Blank Slate" for "Genetic Constraint" is not just an intellectual update, it is an existential trauma.

Because of this, civilization digests truth slowly. We accept the technologies of the new science immediately (we love our GPS and MRI machines), but we reject the implications of the science that built them.

I suspect the length of the "cultural lag" depends on the depth of the belief.

Beliefs about Reality are foundational, they are the bedrock upon which everything else sits. To shift our understanding of the physical universe takes immense pressure and time, perhaps 200+ years. Beliefs about Human Nature sit in the middle, requiring perhaps 100+ years to update. Beliefs about Morality, while emotionally charged, are closer to the surface and more fluid, potentially shifting in just 50+ years.

### Part III: The 22nd Century Mind

If my "Great Latency" hypothesis is true, we can actually attempt to map out what our collective worldview should attempt to digest next, and make a guess of what it might look like in the future.

What does the world look like once we have fully metabolized the concepts discussed above?

#### Reality: From Dead Matter to Resonance & Rendering

The hardest shift will be digesting the triple revolution of Fields (1860s), Relativity (1905), and Quantum Mechanics (1920s-2022).

The Newtonian mind sees the universe as a container filled with dead, solid objects. It believes in a single, objective timeline—a "God's eye view"—that exists whether we are there to see it or not.

The 22nd Century mind will view the universe not as a machine, but as a fluid, participatory hologram.

**First, we will accept Continuity (The Field).** We will abandon the illusion of "Empty Space." Newtonian physics taught us that we are separate islands floating in a void. Faraday and Maxwell proved that the space between us is actually a medium, a web of invisible fields that connects everything to everything else. The future mind will view reality not as a collection of isolated parts, but as a seamless whole. We will understand that separation is an optical illusion; at the fundamental level, everything is touching.

**Second, we will accept Relativity (The Perspective).** Just as Einstein destroyed the "Universal Clock," we will finally destroy the "Universal Narrative." We will accept that there is no single, objective reality of the past. Instead of fighting over one dominant version of history, we will understand that truth is a prism. Thousands of valid perspectives exist simultaneously, each defined entirely by the observer's position in spacetime.

**Third, we will accept Participation (The Render).** Finally, digesting the death of "local realism" (Nobel 2022) will turn us from Passive Observers into Active Architects. We will stop viewing the world as a pre-built stage. We will understand that by directing our attention, we are not just watching the world, but actively collapsing probability waves into existence. We are **co-creators** of the "Now," and if the delayed-choice experiments hold up, perhaps even active shapers of our own past.

#### Human Nature: From Blank Slate to Biological Avatar

The shift in how we view ourselves will be just as radical. The 20th-century mind views the human as a "Universal Machine", a blank piece of hardware that can run any software, provided it receives the right education and social conditioning.

**First, we will accept The Template (Genetics).** We will abandon the fantasy of the "Blank Slate." We will accept the data from behavioral genetics: that every human enters the world with a pre-rolled character sheet. Intelligence, temperament, and aptitude are not social constructs, but biological constraints. The goal of society will shift from "fixing" people to fit the system (Social Engineering) to designing systems that fit the people (Niche Construction). We will stop asking "How do we make everyone the same?" and start asking "What is the optimal environment for this specific type of human?"

**Second, we will accept The Mismatch (Evolutionary Psychology).** We will stop viewing our behaviors as "social constructs" invented by a modern culture, and start viewing them as "ancient adaptations" struggling in a modern world. We will accept that we are Pleistocene hunters living in a digital zoo. We will acknowledge that men and women possess distinct, evolved psychological strategies. Not because of sexism, but out of biological realism. We will stop trying to "deconstruct" human nature and start designing systems that are a better fit with our ancient wiring.

**Third, we will accept The Storyteller (The Interface).** Finally, digesting the lessons of Behavioral Economics will end the myth of the "Rational Actor." We will accept that we are not logic machines; we are feeling machines that invent reasons for our instincts after the fact. We will stop designing economics and politics for an idealized human that doesn't exist (Homo Economicus) and start designing for the irrational, emotional, storytelling animal that actually does.

#### Morality: From Ideology to Survival Strategy

Finally, as we digest the lessons of Game Theory and Complexity Science, our view of Morality will shift from Idealistic to Existential.

The 20th-century mind treats morality as a philosophical debate, something we can invent, argue over, and rewrite based on what feels "fair" or "modern" in the moment. 

The 22nd-century mind will view morality as an engineering problem, but one with a spiritual conclusion. By analyzing the mathematics of survival, we are essentially reverse-engineering the **will of the universe** revealed through time.

**First, we will accept The Algorithm (Game Theory).** We will stop viewing ethics as arbitrary social rules and start viewing them as mathematical necessities. We will realize that concepts like trust, reciprocity, and punishment are not "nice ideas" we invented, but the fundamental laws of cooperation required by a chaotic universe. We don't cooperate because it is polite; we cooperate because groups that violate these laws are deleted by reality.

**Second, we will accept The Unit (Sociobiology).** We will abandon the hyper-individualism of the Enlightenment. Understanding Kin Selection, we will accept that the fundamental unit of meaning is not the isolated Self, but the Lineage. We will recognize that self-sacrifice is not a bug, but a feature, a biological imperative that connects us to something larger than our own brief lives. We will stop seeing society as a collection of atomized individuals and start seeing it as a living super-organism.

**Third, we will accept The Revelation (Time).** Finally, digesting the Lindy Effect will lead us to a startling conclusion: 

> Ethics of divine origin do still exist, even without a God.

We will realize that the morals which endure through millennia of cultural evolution are, in every practical sense, the ones creation itself has chosen. Evolution becomes the invisible judge, rewarding *"divine"* values with continuity and condemning *"demonic"* values to extinction.

### Conclusion

I've only scratched the surface here, but I hope the core idea is clear: the worldview shared by most people today rests on foundations laid centuries ago.

The default assumptions that shape how we see reality, morality, and human nature were largely born in the eras of Newton, Locke, and Marx. The radical insights of the 20th century; Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Evolutionary Psychology, Complexity Science, have yet to truly reshape how ordinary people feel about the world.

There is a Cultural Latency between discovery and belief, a delay between what we know to be true in a lab and what we feel to be true in our bones.

As for my predictions in the previous section, what the "22nd-Century Mind" will actually look like, they are, of course, just guesses. History rarely moves in straight lines. We may digest these discoveries in ways I cannot currently imagine, or new breakthroughs in the coming decades might upend the board entirely before we even finish processing the last round.

But the specific details of the prediction matter less than the realization of the process itself.

We are not at the "end of history" or the peak of understanding. We are simply at a specific point on the timeline, perpetually lagging behind our own discoveries. By the time we finally digest the science of the 1900s, the breakthroughs of the 2100s will likely already be rendering them obsolete.

We are always chasing the horizon.
